	<h2>Welcome to the about page</h2>
	
	<p>The idea behind this websight was to make a place where events around campus could be shaired. To make it interesting i focoused on getting allot of the styling and grafics on the websight right. To this end i opted for a popup login rather thatn one that sends you to another page. In addition i looed at color scheemes and after much hard work figured out how to do css gradents well. I also tryed to make my webight as interactive as possable with slider and othere such intresting elements for the user. I do beleve that the password recovery feture for the events is currently broken but i am using dates in my other form so that should cover me for specials i think. i spent a good 3 hours trying to figure out how i maged to brake it but have been unsuccessfull it also the reason this is late I did not realise the time when I got stuck with that. I hope my othere work can make up for this shortcomming.
